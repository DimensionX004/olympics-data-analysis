### Project Overview

 This was the last problem of the course. It was a mixed bag of coding.


### Learnings from the project

 Learnt a lot about data science and python which will help me in the future.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 This is a good example of complex data science problem. This might not be as tough as an industry-standard but is a very good sight for individuals like us.


### Challenges faced

 Faced a lot of basic problems and made a lot of silly errors but got help from the community and the web.


### Additional pointers

 Nothing as such as this is my first course in the filed of data science with python
